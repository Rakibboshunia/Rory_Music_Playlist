      <h2 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. PAID PLAYLISTS</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Paid playlists and any paid upgrades are provided as digital content on
        a one-off purchase basis.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        By purchasing, you acknowledge that access to digital content is
        provided immediately and you waive your statutory right to cancel once
        access is granted.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Accordingly, all payments for paid playlists are non-refundable once
        access has been provided, except where required by law.

      <p className="mb-6">

        method.

      <p>
        Where access to playlists requires use of third-party platforms (such
        as Spotify), Soundtrack My Night is not responsible for refunds related
        to third-party service availability.
